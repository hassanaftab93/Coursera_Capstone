# Coursera_Capstone
Project - Applied Data Science Capstone - Coursera

## Week 1: Introduction

In this assignment, you will be asked to create a new repository on your Github account, and to create a Jupyter Notebook and submit a shareable link to it for peer evaluation.

Now, start a Jupyter Notebook using any platform that you are comfortable with and do the following:

1. Write some markdown to explain that this notebook will be mainly used for the capstone project.
2. Import the pandas library as pd.
3. Import the Numpy library as np.
4. Print the following the statement: Hello Capstone Project Course!
5. Push the Notebook to your Github repository and submit a link to the notebook on your Github repository.

## Week 2: Foursquare API

You will learn in detail how to make calls to the Foursquare API for different purposes. You will learn how to use a URL to send a request to the API to search for a specific type of venues, to explore a particular venue, to explore a Foursquare user, to explore a geographical location, and to get trending venues around a location.

Also, you will learn how to use the visualization library, Folium, to visualize the results.

## Week 3: K-means Clustering and Segmenting

### Lab 1: Clustering

There are many models for clustering out there. In this lab, we will be presenting the model that is considered the one of the simplest model among them. 

Despite its simplicity, *K*-means is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from unlabeled data.

### Lab 2: Segmentation of Neighborhoods in NY City

In this lab, you will convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values. Also, you will use the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in New York City.

You will be required to use the **explore** function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters.

You will use the _k_-means clustering algorithm to complete this task.

Finally, you will use the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in New York City and their emerging clusters.

### Project Submission: Segmentation and Clustering of Neighborhoods in Toronto

In this lab, you will convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values. Also, you will use the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in Toronto.

Explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. You can decide to work with only boroughs that contain the word Toronto and then replicate the same analysis we did to the New York City data. It is up to you. 

Just make sure:

1. To add enough Markdown cells to explain what you decided to do and to report any observations you make. 
2. To generate maps to visualize your neighborhoods. 
3. You will use the _k_-means clustering algorithm to complete this task.
4. Finally, you will use the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in Toronto and their emerging clusters.
