# Coursera_Capstone
Project - Applied Data Science Capstone - Coursera

## Week 1: Introduction

In this assignment, you will be asked to create a new repository on your Github account, and to create a Jupyter Notebook and submit a shareable link to it for peer evaluation.

Now, start a Jupyter Notebook using any platform that you are comfortable with and do the following:

1. Write some markdown to explain that this notebook will be mainly used for the capstone project.
2. Import the pandas library as pd.
3. Import the Numpy library as np.
4. Print the following the statement: Hello Capstone Project Course!
5. Push the Notebook to your Github repository and submit a link to the notebook on your Github repository.

## Week 2: Foursquare API

You will learn in detail how to make calls to the Foursquare API for different purposes. You will learn how to use a URL to send a request to the API to search for a specific type of venues, to explore a particular venue, to explore a Foursquare user, to explore a geographical location, and to get trending venues around a location.

Also, you will learn how to use the visualization library, Folium, to visualize the results.

## Week 3: K-means Clustering and Segmenting

There are many models for clustering out there. In this lab, we will be presenting the model that is considered the one of the simplest model among them. 

Despite its simplicity, *K*-means is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from unlabeled data.
